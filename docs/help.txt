1. How to resolve error like?
-> Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/prashant/Documents/practice/python/py-imgprocessing/py_imgprocessor/py_imgprocessor/main.py", line 1, in <module>
    from .pdf.utils import PDFTool
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package

solution:
-> first approach if your code or project intended to be module then you can excute it like below
cmd: python -m py_imgprocessor.main

solution 2:
-> second approach if your code or project you want to run like normal python script you can do so by.
cmd: export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/parent_directory_of_py_imgprocessor:$PYTHONPATH
eg: export PYTHONPATH=/home/prashant/Documents/practice/python/py-imgprocessing/py_imgprocessor:$PYTHONPATH
cmd: python py_imgprocessor/main.py

-> still has an error then check, is it python was set in system path.
-> python -c "import sys; print(sys.path)"


2. how to run tests?
->
python -m unittest discover -v
python tests/test_pdf_tool.py -v
